Vanity URL is a way to change your zoom links from the default one. This is a case when you as a user have purchased a custom URL in zoom to join or start your meetings. 

### Basic Usage

In the settings page, you will find an option called "`Vanity URL`".

** Changing or adding new values in the "Vanity URL" field will change the way how links are displayed on frontend.**

### Example

* If you add link such as "example.zoom.us" in the textbox field.
* Links displayed in the frontend pages would look like `example.zoom.us/j/12312321` instead of the default `zoom.us/j/1232321`
* So only, change this if you have a custom domain or you do not have default `zoom.us/j/21321` link

Easy right ?
