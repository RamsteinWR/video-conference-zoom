Overriding the template means to change the layout of how the content is displayed in frontend.

### Overriding the Parent

* Here, parent is the `Video conferencing with zoom api` main plugin templates folder.
* All frontend templates are stored inside `wp-admin/plugins/video-conferencing-with-zoom-api/templates/` folder.

To override, copy files from `wp-admin/plugins/video-conferencing-with-zoom-api/templates/` folder to `wp-content/yourtheme/video-conferencing-zoom/` folder.

You're Done !

You can change the layout of the pages anyway you want.
