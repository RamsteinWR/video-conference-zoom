### Purpose

This functionality allows you to import your Zoom Meetings from your Zoom Account to your WordPress site if that meeting already does not exists on your site.

### Limitations

Currently, import only allows you to import your Zoom Meetings which are scheduled meeting. Recurring Meetings and webinars are not allowed to be imported yet. This will be coming soon.

### How to ?

1. Goto Zoom Meetings > Sync page
2. Choose which user you would like to import from.
3. Select your meetings to be imported.

**`NOTE: You can only import 10 meetings at a time. This is done to reduce API call usage and avoiding API call exhaustion on the server side.`**
